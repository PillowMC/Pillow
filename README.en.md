## Fabric that runs on Forge

_Not implemented yet._

Yes, you can believe it. This mod will make Fabric compatible with Forge.

_Don't put Fabric mods in mods directory, put them in fabricMods directory!_

## Another mod loader

_Will implement after running Fabric on Forge!_

It will design mainly for "build bridges" between Forge and Fabric, but it may will be a full-usage mod loader. It will not replace Forge or Fabric. It will work well with them.
