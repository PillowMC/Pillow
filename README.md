## Quilt that runs on Forge

_Not implemented yet._

Yes, you can believe it. This mod will make Quilt compatible with Forge.

_Don't put Quilt mods in mods directory, put them in quiltMods directory!_

## Another mod loader

_Will implement after running Quilt on Forge!_

It will design mainly for "build bridges" between Forge and Quilt, but it will be a full-usage mod loader. It will not replace Forge or Quilt. It will work well with them.

## Installing
